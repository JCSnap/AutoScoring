Question: What is a food chain?
Model Answer: A food chain is a linear sequence of organisms where each one is eaten by the next member in the sequence. It begins with producer organisms, like plants, and ends with apex predators, followed by decomposers.
Student Answer: Food chain? That's just the order of who eats who in nature. It starts with plants and ends with the big, scary predators. Once they're gone, the leftovers are handled by those cleanup bugs and organisms.

Question: Explain the concept of gravitational force.
Model Answer: Gravitational force is a force of attraction that exists between any two masses, any two bodies, any two particles. It is mathematically described by Newton's law of universal gravitation.
Student Answer: Gravitational force is like a magnetic pull that happens between any two things that have mass. It's what Newton was talking about when he said everything in the universe pulls on everything else.

Question: How does the respiratory system function?
Model Answer: The respiratory system's primary function is to supply the blood with oxygen so that the blood can deliver oxygen to all parts of the body. This process happens through breathing: inhaling oxygen-rich air and exhaling air filled with carbon dioxide, which is a waste product.
Student Answer: The job of the respiratory system is to get oxygen into the blood so the blood can take it to all parts of the body. This happens when we breathe: we suck in air that's full of oxygen and blow out air that's full of carbon dioxide, which is like the body's trash.
