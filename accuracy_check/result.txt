Question: An electromagnetic wave has a frequency of 4 MHz. Calculate its wavelength in meters. (1 MHz = 1 × 10^6 Hz)
Options:
A. 75 meters
B. 60 meters
C. 120 meters
D. 100 meters
Answer: A

Step 1: Convert 4 MHz to Hz → 4 MHz × (1 × 10^6 Hz/1 MHz) = 4 × 10^6 Hz
Step 2: Rearrange the formula to find the wavelength → λ = c/f
Step 3: Substitute the values and solve for λ → λ = (3 × 10^8 m/s) / (4 × 10^6 Hz) = 75 meters

Thus, the correct answer is A. 75 meters.
